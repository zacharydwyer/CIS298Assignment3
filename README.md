## Author



## Description

-----This is not finished yet-----

Create a master detail application to view the contents of a beverage list.
The master part will display a list of all of the beverage items in the list.
The Detail part will display the details of a specific beverage item.
The User should be able to go up and down items in the list by swiping left or right on a detail page.
The App should look like the screen shots I have provided.
There is no need to save any information changed in the application to the CSV file.

The properties of the CSV file are as follows:
1. Item Number
2. Item Description
3. Item Pack Size
4. Case Price
5. Currently Active Item

Solution Requirements:

* Portrat Master layout
* Landscape Master layout
* Portrait Detail layout
* Landscape Detail layout
* Fragments for all of the layouts
* Class to represent a Beverage Item
* ArrayList for the list of Beverage Items
* ListView to display the master view
* Read in CSV file and create ArrayList of Beverage Items from the data in the CSV file
* Use View Pager to swipe left and right on detail page to go up and down in the list
* Should look like the screen shots provided
* Remember Documentation, and README

### Notes

The book does not cover how to read in a CSV file, however, it should be fairly easy to find on the internet. If more help is needed, we can do something in class.
